# Interactive Chest Project

## Overview
The Interactive Chest Project is a creative and educational Arduino-based endeavor that combines sound detection and distance testing to create an engaging interactive experience. Users activate the chest by clapping or snapping their fingers, initiating a sequence where they must pass a distance-based test to unlock the chest and claim a prize.

## Components
- Arduino UNO: Central control for the entire system.
- Sound Sensor: Detects specific sounds to initiate the game.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance for the interactive test.
- Servo Motor: Actuates the chest door based on the distance test result.
- Confirmation Button: Allows users to confirm correct object placement.
- LCD Screen: Displays relevant information and game status.
- LEDs: Visual indicators for the current game state.
- Buzzer: Audible signal for successful game completion.
- Infrared Sensor (Optional): Detects when the prize is removed, triggering the automatic closing of the chest door.
- Chest Structure: Physical construction materials for the chest and servo-controlled door.
